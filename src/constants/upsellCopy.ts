/**
 * Upgrade CTA copy, keyed by the gated feature. Mirror of
 * apps/web/src/constants/upsellCopy.ts — keep the voices in sync.
 *
 * Tone rules (keep every entry honest to these):
 * - Rider-to-rider, never SaaS-salesy. Lead with the riding/wrenching
 *   benefit, not "upgrade now". One cultural wink per surface, max.
 * - CTAs live only where the missing value is felt in context. No launch
 *   modals, no interstitials, no push-notification upsells, no urgency or
 *   scarcity language, no "unlock" spam.
 * - One inline upsell card per screen, max — every other gated spot gets a
 *   quiet Pro chip. Dismissed cards stay dismissed (persisted per surface).
 * - Never upsell inside error paths, except the bike-limit message.
